PREFACE.

Or the three kinds of poetical composition edrich, in accord-
ance with the Apostle's direction, have ever been in use in the
Church, “ Psahm and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,” two are
supplied by inspiration. We have no need, through God’s
bounty, to turn our thoughts to the composition of Psalms or
Songs3 and, to judge from the a'ttempts which have been made,
doubtless we are unequal to it. And the unapproachable ex·-
cellence of the two which have been supplied serves to suggest
the difficulties which beset the composition of the third which
has not been supplied. Indeed, it is hardly too strong to say
that to write Hyrnns is as much beyond us as to originate
Psalmody. The peculiarity of the Psalms is their coming
nearer than any other kind of devotion to a converse with

the powers of the unseen world. They are longer and freer¹
